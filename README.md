# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## What are 3D FrankenPunks?

### **10,000 Generative FrankenPunks at 0.088 ETH each**

Dr Ethvil is a mad genius that has created the FrankenPunks from the Punk Trash amidst the chilling NFT winter. These punks have been taken for a devilish deed...

This is a great opportunity... but with opportunity comes DANGER.&#x20;

To live, these punk monstrosities will need to be cared for by a group of do-good FrankenPunks and if cared for properly, they will be generously rewarded by Dr. Ethvil with tiny fractional pieces of these CryptoPunks Monstrosities being distributed to his most helpful Punksville community Members.&#x20;

Join us in the riskiest game in NFT history thus far...
