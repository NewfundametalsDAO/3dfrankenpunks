# ðŸ“¨ Proposals

### On-Chain Voting

When consensus on a proposal is reached, an on-chain vote becomes activated. All 10,000 community members can participate and vote (equally), but citizens can also choose to delegate their vote to a particular governor or citizen (vote by proxy). In the absence of citizens delegating their vote through the voting platform or making a vote in time, that citizenâ€™s vote will be automatically delegated to the Minister of the Vault that citizenâ€™s 3DFP is associated with (see Principalities). On-chain proposals require a two-thirds majority vote approval. If an on-chain vote reaches consensus, an experiment is created and sent to the High-Council to approve or veto the experiment. If an experiment is vetoed by the High Council, the experiment will be deemed closed and any new experiments will need to be started by a new citizenâ€™s proposal.

### Community Wallet Votes&#x20;

If a proposal to use the community wallet funds has less than 50% of the community votes, it will automatically be delegated to Governors to vote, who shall be required to submit a vote on behalf of all citizens. If the vote is ratified, the proposed use of community wallet funds will be sent to the High Council to execute. If Governors are not able to pass a community wallet vote proposal by a majority, the vote shall be rejected. The High Council shall have the authority to execute approved proposals or to veto them back to the community, rejecting the proposal and restarting the community proposal process.

### High Council Agents&#x20;

&#x20;The High Council shall have the authority to appoint and engage Agents, Assistants, ETHvil Minions, and any other form of help to successfully run experiments. These Agents may be designated roles in different sub-entity structures, called Executive Organizations, such as development, creative arts, merchandise, sales, marketing, etc. The High Council shall have the authority, but not the duty to create as many Executive Organizations as they deem necessary to carry out the experiments.
