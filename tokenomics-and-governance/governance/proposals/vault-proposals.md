# ðŸŽ’ Vault Proposals

### 4 NFT Vaults (4 Principalities)&#x20;

Each Vault represents a principality, and each principality gets one leader that they elect to represent them. Principalities will be managed by Ministers of the vaults. Ministers are tasked with running their respective vaults, and for acting as a representative delegated vote of any citizens who fail to participate in a vote on a proposal. Thus ministerâ€™s votes represent their Principality when citizens do not participate, and is a critical role which accounts for non-citizen engagement.\
\
Vault 1 represents 3D Frankenpunks 1-2500. Vault 2 represents 3D Frankenpunks 2501-5000. Vault 3 represents 3D Frankenpunks 5001-7500. Vault 4 represents 3D Frankenpunks 7501-10,000. Each Minister will be elected to serve on the High Council, shall be given a wallet shard, and can be removed by a two-thirdâ€™s vote by the citizens in their Principality or by a majority vote of the High Council. Initial election of Ministers shall be made by the High Council, and each Minister of each Principality is required to own a 3DFP that corresponds to their Principality.

### Vault Proposals

Citizens of each respective Principality shall be able to make Vault Proposals for the vaults their Principality holds to their Ministers. A two-thirdâ€™s vote shall be required for their Minister to approve or reject a Vault Proposal. If a Minister approves a Vault Proposal, they shall have the executive authority to act on the proposal in accordance with the will of the Citizens of their Principality, except in issues where the proposal is to liquidate the vaulted CryptoPunk. In the case that a Principality Vault Proposal is to liquidate a vaulted CryptoPunk, the Minister of such Principality shall bring the proposal to the High-Council to be voted on for approval.
