## What is "Community" Governance?

Community governance is a collective term used to define the process of putting forward experiments and having the Punksville community come to consensus on the use of "Franken Bank" funds.&#x20;

As a community all citizens will be tasked with putting forward "experiments" to be carried out by the High Council.

**These "experiments" are proposed everyday and carried out in quarterly voting**&#x20;
