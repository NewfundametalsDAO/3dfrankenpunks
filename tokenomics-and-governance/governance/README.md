# ðŸ“” Governance

#### How $FRANKEN Governance Works

Governance proposals will be submitted and voted on through [https://www.snapshot.org/](https://www.snapshot.org). There can be an unlimited number of proposals submitted by $FRANKEN holders and voted on. Some examples include:

* Setting a Punks Vault reserve price
* Use of DAO funds for the purchase of new CryptoPunks
* Use of the punks for advertising applications (billboards, merchandise, etc.)

In order for a proposal to be passed, it must receive a majority 2/3 vote based on the total $FRANKEN token holders.
