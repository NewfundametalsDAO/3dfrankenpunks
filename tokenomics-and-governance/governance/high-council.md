# ðŸ¤  Actions

### High Council&#x20;

The High Council is not responsible for making proposals, but for enacting experiments.&#x20;

&#x20;9 High Council members review proposals that are on-chain, and either approve or veto the proposal.&#x20;

High Council members are made up of 4 Ministers, one from each Principality representing each CryptoPunks Vault, 3 core team members (including Dr. ETHvil), and 2 representatives, one each from Governors and Citizens. Dr. ETHvil is the President of the High Council and shall ultimately run the experiments that are brought to the High Council or delegate experiments to the rest of the High Council and underlying Agents.

The High Council has veto power over experiments as a check on the Legislative Branch, but its job is to ultimately run experiments and to employ agents and assistants to help run experiments at the will of the community. The success or failure of experiments is completely unknown, just as all science experiments are, but the direction of the experiments is completely directed by the Citizens, Governors, and Ministers of Punksville.

### High Council Agents

The High Council shall have the authority to appoint and engage Agents, Assistants, ETHvil Minions, and any other form of help to successfully run experiments. These Agents may be designated roles in different sub-entity structures, called Executive Organizations, such as development, creative arts, merchandise, sales, marketing, etc. The High Council shall have the authority, but not the duty to create as many Executive Organizations as they deem necessary to carry out the experiments.
