# âœ‰ Proposals & Voting

## Overview

Proposals can be submitted and voted upon by any community member. &#x20;

All proposals will be submitted an voted on through our snapshot.org channel and will be discussed through our Discord server.&#x20;

If a Punksville community member wishes to create a proposal, they must draft it first and post it to the community forum. We expect that proposals are well researched and have interest from the broader community in order to be put up for a vote.&#x20;

Any questions regarding proposals can be asked to a High Council Member (Core Team).
