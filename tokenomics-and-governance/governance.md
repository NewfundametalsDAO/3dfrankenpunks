# ðŸ“” Governance

### How FrankenPunks Governance Works

The Punksville community requires a solid governance structure that ensures community proposed solutions .

In order for this to happen we have implemented an accountable governance structure in order to ensure the longevity of the community.&#x20;

_**This structure will serve as v.1 of what we intend to formalize under a tokenized legal structure.** _&#x20;

### Responsibilities of Members:

#### Community - Proposes and votes on broad based strategy for "FrankenBank" & CryptoPunk Vaults

* **Governors** - check quality of citizen experiments and enact consensus amongst governors
* **Citizens** - propose experiments and champion representatives to the high council&#x20;

#### High Council - Engages with community and performs experiments&#x20;

#### Core Team Members and elected Stakeholders from the Governors and Citizens&#x20;

### How Experiments are Run?

Frankenpunks is structured as a community run project and with that&#x20;
