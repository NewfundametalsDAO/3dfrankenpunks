# ðŸ“” Governance

### How FrankenPunks Governance Works

_**This structure will serve as v.1 of what we intend to formalize under a community governance structure.**_

## Experiments

#### The goal of governance is to pass the best experiments

Frankenpunks is structured as a community run project and with that citizens have the ability to put forward "experiments" to be run with the use of the "Franken Bank".

In order for a experiment to take place it must first qualify and pass the community checks.&#x20;

Dr. ETHvil performs the experiments, the community proposes them.

## 3 Pillars of Punksville

### 1. Proposals (Creating Experiments)

#### Community - NFT Vaults & "Franken Bank" Wallet

10,000 Citizens get to make proposals to the governors. Each NFT holder represents 1 citizen. One person can potentially have more than one vote if they hold multiple NFTs.&#x20;

### 2. Action (Performing Experiments)&#x20;

**High Council â€“ 9 High Council members review proposals that are on-chain, and either approve or veto the proposal.**&#x20;

High Council members are made up of Ministers, one from each Principality representing each CryptoPunks Vault, 3 core team members (including Dr. ETHvil), and 2 representatives, one each from Governors and Citizens. Dr. ETHvil is the President of the High Council and shall ultimately run the experiments that are brought to the High Council or delegate experiments to the rest of the High Council and underlying Agents.

High Council Role â€“ The High Council is not responsible for making proposals, but for executing proposals that are passed.&#x20;

High Council Agents â€“ The High Council shall have the authority to appoint and engage Agents, Assistants, ETHvil Minions, and any other form of help to successfully run experiments.&#x20;

### 3. Dispute Resolution&#x20;

Dispute resolution is the final pillar of governance required to organize a long-lasting and successful community. The community makes proposals in the Legislative Branch, community proposals are acted on in the Executive Branch, but to the extent that disputes arise between Citizens, Governors, Ministers, High Council members or their Agents and Executive Organizations, a dispute resolution process shall be used to settle all disputes within Punksville. Any resolution reached by the dispute resolution process shall be final and will not have the possibility of appeal.
