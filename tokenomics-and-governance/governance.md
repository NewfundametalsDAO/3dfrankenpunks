# ðŸ“” Governance

### How FrankenPunks Governance Works

_**This structure will serve as v.1 of what we intend to formalize under a tokenized legal structure (DAO).** _&#x20;

### Responsibilities of Members

#### Community - Proposes and votes on broad based strategy for "FrankenBank" & CryptoPunk (NFT) Vaults

* **Governors** - check quality of citizen experiments and enact consensus amongst governors
* **Citizens** - propose experiments and champion representatives to the high council&#x20;

#### High Council - Engages with community and performs experiments&#x20;



### How Experiments are Run?

Frankenpunks is structured as a community run project and with that citizens have the ability to put forward "experiments" to be run with the use of the "Franken Bank".

In order for a experiment to take place it must first qualify and pass the community checks.&#x20;
