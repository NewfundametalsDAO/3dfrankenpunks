# ‚ùó The Problem With DAOs

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

How many times have you heard "DAO"?

It's become a **buzzword** in the NFT space; a marketing tool to buff up landing pages.

Most projects fail miserably at explaining how a DAO works, while others have used it as a tool to scam people.&#x20;

This has left many feeling clueless, confused and skeptical of DAOs (rightfully so).

> So you might be wondering... "**How is this DAO going to be different?**" "How can we trust that you will actually deliver real governance and utility?"

Trust is something that must be built and is vital to a successful DAO. There is a popular saying that goes like "be the change you desire", which is why our entire team is doxxed. This holds us accountable and shows that we're serious. We're building something incredible that you will love to be a part of.

Most DAOs are not thought out, they do not empower the community, their community wallet is not multi-sig, and those who do manage to string together through a DAO offer no real utility outside of voting.

The reality is you want something more than being involved in coin flip discord decisions, you want to be part of a DAO that brings you real world value.

One of our goals with Franken Punks is to revolutionize DAOs; creating a gold standard when it comes to governance and utility. We are expecting many to copy our methods and strategy and we hope they do! We want to elevate the entire space.
