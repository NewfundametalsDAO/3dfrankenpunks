# ðŸ‘¾ Mission

## What's the Point of Punks Vault DAO?

The purpose of the Punks Vault DAO is to give emerging collectors access to one of the strongest and oldest collections in NFTs. Through purchasing and owning CryptoPunks and joining our community, you get real experience valuing, holding, and using the asset itself. Though not viewed as an investment, we aim to give real utility to our DAO project rather than the window-shopping nature of others that were created.&#x20;

Punks Vault DAO is the DAO that holds and manages the Larva Labs CryptoPunks for the FrankenPunks members.&#x20;

Our number one goal with this project is to redefine what it means to be a member of a DAO and lower the barriers of entry to access original Larva Labs CryptoPunks.&#x20;

We have created this DAO to:

* Give people full rights and governance over Larva Labs CryptoPunks
* Create real value for collectors rather than just a token representing a stake in a DAO
* Show collectors the value in a great long term hold
* Create a community of likeminded collectors who value holding CryptoPunks
* Lower barriers to access Blue Chip NFTs
* Have fun :)
