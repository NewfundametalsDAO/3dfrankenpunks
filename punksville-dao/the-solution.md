# ðŸ‘Œ The Solution

**Education is the key to happiness.** We're going to make it simple to understand what a DAO is.

Our goal is to have your grandma be able to wrap her head around our DAO. This is why we have an expert animator creating our Franken Punks explainer videos.

As we mentioned before, our DAO treasury will have multiple vaults, giving our community a wider selection of Crypto Punks to buy, with the option to sell the vault and payout holders at any time.

Our treasury is dedicated to only buying Larva Labs Crypto Punks, the most established blue chip NFT.

We will be creating an **intelligent hierarchy.**&#x20;

Most DAOs don't have a meaningful hierarchy that protects the community's interest. We will be creating a High Council, where community members are thoroughly vetted and elected to join the council and govern the vaults.

Our team will hold the majority of governance in the beginning of the project to protect you from bad agents with malintent. If 100% of governance is available from the get go, a whale could come and buy a majority of the tokens and ruin the DAO if they wanted to.

This is why we will be issuing tokens to trusted members through our Disocrd and creating the High Council.&#x20;

Overtime as we vet people, the governance will be distributed to the point where we no longer hold a majority and the High Council will be a decentralized and trusted authority to govern the vaults.
