# ðŸŽ¯ The Plan

This is not your average NFT project and we're doing a few things different to fix the holes we've seen from community governed projects of the past.

Like our predecessors, our primary goal of the project is to lower the barriers of entry to "**Blue Chip**" NFTs and grant full governance/ownership.&#x20;

**Coming Soon: A token called $FRANKEN will act as a reputational/governance token for the project. This on-chain incentive system is asset backed by the value and Performance of the Punks Vaults and Treasury. We plan to explore a tokenized legal structure at a later date.**&#x20;
