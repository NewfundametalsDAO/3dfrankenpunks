# üèµ Community Governed Wallet

### **Community Resources**

Since the time we have launched we have believed in the power of community sourced value.&#x20;

We have seen first hand what leading members of our community can do with examples stemming from design, development, Community Mods etc.&#x20;

Accountability over resources will be delegated to the community through the community governance process.&#x20;
