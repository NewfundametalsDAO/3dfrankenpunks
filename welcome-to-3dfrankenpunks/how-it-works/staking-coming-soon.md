# ðŸ§Ÿâ™€ Staking (Coming Soon)&#x20;

## What is Staking?

"Staking" is a buzzword that you've probably seen thrown around Crypto Twitter (CT) and Discord a lot recently. **Staking is the process of committing your assets for a period of time to support a project or protocol that you believe in.** For early utility cases, in return, you typically receive passive income or interest on your staked assets. DAOs have added a new use case: governance.

DAOs have allowed users to stake their tokens and in return, earn more governance rights over the assets the DAO owns. DAOs use this model because a DAO's success is reliant on giving its most devout supporters the most control over the direction of the project. FrankenPunks will be using this method to grow and distribute our governance token.

### How Can You Stake?

We have decided to pause the staking portion of our project as we remain committed to building a strong community.

This will be coming very soon!
