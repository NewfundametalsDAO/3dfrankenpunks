# ❓ How it Works

### Build an **Organic Community**&#x20;

We believe that our community is everything. A strong community is the backbone of every successful project.&#x20;

Through community sourced voting and approval process we believe that we can create value for all holders.&#x20;

### Franken Values and Goals

* **Community**&#x20;

**Treat your fellow Frankens with respect. We are intolerant of negative and abusive behavior, we won’t hesitate to punish toxicity. When we are discussing proposals and the project’s direction, we should all maintain a high level of respect and understanding to everyone regardless of their opinions.**&#x20;

* **Responsibility**&#x20;

**Responsibility is integral to the project’s future. Which is why we will be extra careful with how we use the funds and we will not be taking unnecessary risks that could jeopardize the project’s success.**&#x20;

* **Experimentation**&#x20;

&#x20;**From day 1 we’ve made sure to create milestones that are actually achievable. We will test and experiment new ideas before officially launching them. It is important to us that we validate our ideas before we allocate resources to it.**

### **Responsibility of Holders**

We are turning the responsibility for project direction over to our community through a governance process that allows for movement throughout the levels of governance.&#x20;

1. &#x20;Citizen - Community Member
   * Holds a FrankenPunk & Proposes experiments&#x20;
2. Governor - Elected Official in Punksville
   * Holds a FrankenPunk and demonstrates leadership and the necessary skill to advance the project&#x20;
3. High Council - Founders/Core Team & Community Delegates
   * Multi-Sig holder and Executes "experiments"
     *   Will hold elections for community representatives&#x20;

         * &#x20;Consists of 2 Governors and 1 Citizen with term limits&#x20;
