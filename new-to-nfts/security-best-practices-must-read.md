# ðŸ”“ Security Best Practices (MUST READ!)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

**Your Seed Phrase is Everything**&#x20;

Don't let anyone see it. Don't store it online. - Use a physical wallet, like a Trezor (or paper, stored in a safe) - Use 2FA (two-factor authentication whenever possible).

**Basic Routine**

Regularly disconnect sites from MetaMask as a cleanup - Question any last changes mint date changes - reach out to Discord Mods to ask if an update is legit.

Generally speaking make sure your passwords are strong, don't use the same email or password for everything. Try to use an authenticator app over an SMS method for 2FA (search up sim swap).

**Don't Get Scammed** &#x20;

Updates in Discord announce should be from community members and not bots - Don't trust links/addresses from anybody without independent verification - Check for the correct URL  if you are using the frontend

99% of DMs on your discord will be spammers shilling you some NFT or token, or an imitator of a project trying to scam you (ignore them). We will never DM you, if there's something of important related to you, you will be tagged in our server via a bot or a mod.

**Blocking Spammers**

It's a great idea to go to your discord **Settings (gear icon near your display pic)** > **Privacy & Safety > Allow direct messages from discord servers (check it off).** This way you won't be solicited by spammers, if you're interested in DM'ing someone from a server just add them as a friend and you're good to go.

**Franken Punks Team Security**

Everyone on our team has 2FA on their discord. This makes it impossible for a hacker to compromise our accounts. We have also have a 2 step verification to enter our discord (welcome screen & reaction bot) to create a barrier against bots and spammers. We've brought on several trusted mods to prevent people from breaking our community guidelines keeping the Franken Punksville secure.

Our roles and permissions have been quadruple-checked to make sure no one can be promoted to a role that can comprise the server.
