### Installing MetaMask

The first thing you need to do is install a Web3 wallet so you can own NFTs! The easiest wallet to use is MetaMask.

1.) Go to https://www.metamask.io and click "Download Now". It will then prompt you to install MetaMask on your preferred browser.

2.) Click "Add to Chrome" or whichever browser you use.

4.) Click on "Create a Wallet."

5.) Follow the prompts, watch the "Secure Your Wallet" tutorial, and make sure to WRITE DOWN your seed phrase. Do not send it to yourself through email, physically write it down on 3-4 sheets of paper. Take those papers and put them in very safe places.

**\*\* Your seed phrase is the most important phrase you own. This is an all-access pass to your Web3 Wallet. Never give it to ANYONE.** \*\* ****&#x20;

6.) Now that you have written down your seed phrase and set up your wallet. You will be looking at your MetaMask dashboard. This dashboard allows you to find your wallet address and send/receive ETH and other ETH-based cryptos.

* Underneath "Account 1" you can copy your ETH address.
* If you know your recipient's ETH address, click "send", paste their address in, and choose the amount of ETH you wish to send.
