# ðŸ’¸ How to buy Ethereum (ETH)

This is a step-by-step tutorial on the safest way to purchase Ethereum (ETH)!

1.) Create a Coinbase account on https://www.coinbase.com. It's not a long process and is the easiest way to purchase cryptocurrency.&#x20;

2.) After signing up, you will be transferred to their dashboard. On the left-hand side of the dashboard, there is a button labeled "Trade". Click on it.

3.) You will now be on a page that looks similar to the one below. Click "Buy" on the right-hand side of the crypto you wish to purchase. A window will pop up similar to this. Now, in the "Pay With" section, if you purchase ETH with a bank transfer or wire, it will take 3-5 days to be transferrable. However, if you purchase it with a debit card, it will be transferrable instantly.

4.) Once you have purchased your Ethereum, it will now show up in your balance on Coinbase! Great work, our first job is complete. Now we need to get it over to your MetaMask.

5.) Either on the dashboard or on the "Trade" screen, click on "Send/Receive" in the top right-hand corner. A new window will pop up.

7.) Your ETH will take roughly 5-10minutes to transfer from Coinbase as they use very low gas fees for their transactions. You now have ETH in your MetaMask!
