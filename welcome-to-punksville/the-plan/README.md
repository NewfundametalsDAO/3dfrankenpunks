description: How are we different from other DAOs?

# ðŸŽ¯ The Plan

This is **NOT** your average **DAO** project and we're doing a few things different to fix the holes we've seen from DAOs we have participated in.

Like our predeccesors, our primary goal of the project is to lower the barriers of entry to "**Blue Chip**" NFTs and grant full governance/ownership. Similarly, we start by fractionalizing the NFTs themselves.

However, our revolutionary change is **separate vaults** for each NFT. Giving the community complete control over the individual asset and not the "basket" of assets. This will allow for separate voting for each asset and will allow us to return value to DAO members.

**A token called $FRANKEN will act as a reputational/governance token for the project. By minting and participating in the FrankenPunks project you can earn this token which provides access to the FrankenTower On-chain Game. This on-chain game is asset backed by the value and Performance of the Punks Vaults and Treasury.**&#x20;

A few ways to earn $FRANKEN are by participating in the genesis mint, staking your Frankenpunk in our staking contract, or being an active community member in our various social channels and events.&#x20;

## Our Milestones

_25% Sold_ - Buy first punk and fractionalize it in Punk Vault 1

_50% Sold_ - Buy second punk and fractionalize it in Punk Vault 2

_75% Sold_ - Buy third punk and fractionalize it in in Punk Vault 3

_100% Sold_ - Buy fourth punk and fractionalize it in Punk Vault 4

**Post Sell-Out:** Transfer Vault 1 tokens, Vault 2 tokens, Vault 3 tokens, & Vault 4 tokens to the community governed gnosis wallet, airdrop $Franken to OG members and Genesis Minters, and release staking for all FrankenPunk Holders.
