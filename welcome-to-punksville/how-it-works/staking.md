# ðŸ§Ÿâ™€ Staking

## What is Staking?

"Staking" is a buzzword that you've probably seen thrown around Crypto Twitter (CT) and Discord a lot recently. **Staking is the process of committing your assets for a period of time to support a project or protocol that you believe in.** For early utility cases, in return, you typically receive passive income or interest on your staked assets. DAOs have added a new use case: governance.

DAOs have allowed users to stake their tokens and in return, earn more governance rights over the assets the DAO owns. DAOs use this model because a DAO's success is reliant on giving its most devout supporters the most control over the direction of the project. FrankenPunks will be using this method to grow and distribute our governance token.

For the Punks Vault DAO, staking is the process of generating utility governance tokens (reputation) in the Punksville community. Each token represents a voting right to the Punksvault DAO.&#x20;

### Why Stake?

In the FrankenPunks universe, staking is one of the only ways supporters can earn governance power over the Punks Vault DAO. Through staking a FrankenPunks NFT, the staker earns DAO governance tokens.

The DAO governance tokens then give the recipient the ability submit proposals, vote on current proposals, and earn rewards during the sale or use of the CryptoPunks in the vault.

### How Can You Stake?

The staking contract is being built as we speak, a step-by-step guide will be released on the process of staking your FrankenPunk NFT, claiming your rewards, and unstaking your FrankenPunk as well.

This will be coming very soon!
