**2) **_****_** Ownership**_**.**_ You Own the NFT. When you purchase a 3DFP NFT, you own the underlying 3DFP Art. Ownership of the 3DFP is mediated entirely by a smart contract and the Ethereum network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any 3DFP.

Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we may grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Art and/or the Name and Likeness to use, copy, or display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (‚ÄúCommercial Use‚Äù). Examples of such Commercial Use could be producing and selling merchandise or displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a venue that permits the display of 3DFPs generally, provided that the venue cryptographically verifies each 3DFPs licensee‚Äôs rights to display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of 3DFPs generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each 3DFPs licensee‚Äôs rights to display the Art of the 3DFP and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the 3DFP leaves the website/application. A Commercial Use license will be considered invalid without our express prior written consent.
