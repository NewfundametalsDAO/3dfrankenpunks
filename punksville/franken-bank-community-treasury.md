# ðŸ’° Franken Bank Community Treasury

Aside from the Larva Labs' CryptoPunks that will be held in our Punks Vault, the FrankenPunk team will also be setting aside >100ETH into a Treasury for use by the community. Purchasing assets is one value add, but setting aside ETH for the community to use to grow, develop, and pursue new goals is also very important to us.&#x20;

### What will the Treasury be used for?

In short, the Punksville members decide how the Treasury will be used. We do intend to receive input from our community regarding Treasury funds.&#x20;

Now, we do have a few suggestions on what it could be used for! Here are a few:

1. **Plan and host IRL/Metaverse events for only FrankenPunk holders:** We would love to have this be more than just a group of NFT collectors, but a real community of friends and people that support each other. We can think of no better way than to rent a storefront or bar for a night and host a FrankenPunk Party!!&#x20;
2. **FrankenPunk SWAG/Merch:** We'd love to produce below-cost merch for everyone who owns a FrankenPunk. It's one thing to be in the community, it's another to rep it everywhere you go. If our community decides they want SWAG (Stuff We All Get), then our designers will begin mocking up designs.
3. **Purchase Another CryptoPunk:** Of course, if the community wants to purchase another CryptoPunk, well that's exactly what we'll do. CryptoPunks are the lynchpin of this project and are the main value add of what we're trying to do here. More CryptoPunks is never a bad thing ðŸ˜Ž
