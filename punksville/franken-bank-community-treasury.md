# ðŸ’° "Franken Bank" Community Treasury

### FrankenBank Overview

Aside from the Larva Labs' CryptoPunks and other NFTs that will be held in our Punks Vault, the FrankenPunk team will also be setting aside >100ETH into a Treasury for use by the community. Purchasing assets is one value add, but setting aside ETH for the community to use to grow, develop, and pursue new goals is also very important to us.&#x20;

### What will the Treasury be used for?

In short, the Punksville members decide how the Treasury will be used. We do intend to receive input from our community regarding Treasury funds.&#x20;

Now, we do have a few suggestions on what it could be used for! Here are a few:

1. **Hire a team to Build:** This could mean paying one of our own community members for their unique skillset, or hiring an outside party to help.  ****&#x20;
2. **Plan and host IRL/Metaverse events for only FrankenPunk holders:** We would love to have this be more than just a group of NFT collectors, but a real community of friends and people that support each other. We can think of no better way than to rent a storefront or bar for a night and host a FrankenPunk Party!!&#x20;
3. **Build a World Renown Brand:** similar to other projects, we can pursue branding and licensing deals, along with sponsorships to grow our community awareness.&#x20;
4. **FrankenPunk SWAG/Merch:** We'd love to produce below-cost merch for everyone who owns a FrankenPunk. It's one thing to be in the community, it's another to rep it everywhere you go. If our community decides they want SWAG (Stuff We All Get), then our designers will begin mocking up designs.
5. **Purchase Other NFTs:** Of course, if the community wants to purchase other blue chip NFT collections, well that's exactly what we'll do. Community governance over NFTs is the core of this project. More NFTs is never a bad thing ðŸ˜Ž
6. **Create more NFTs:** Maybe Dr. ETHvil has more creations in store ðŸ˜ˆ

**We want to make it clear that through community sourced governance, project funds can be used to advance the project and drive value for community members.**
