# ðŸ‘¾ Mission

## What's the Point of Punksville?

The purpose of the "Punksville" and the "Franken Bank"  is to give emerging collectors access to one of the strongest and oldest collections in NFTs as well as direct governance over how community funds are used. Through purchasing and owning CryptoPunks and joining our community, you get real experience valuing, holding, and using the asset itself.&#x20;

Punksville is the collective term for any holder of a FrankenPunk NFT.&#x20;

**Our number one goal with this project is to build a strong community  and source ideas from the community to build a "Blue Chip" NFT brand.**&#x20;
